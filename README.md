Day 6:
Today's Progress:
Today, I focused on learning how to define and call functions in Python. I wrote a simple function my_function() that prints messages to the console. This exercise helped me understand the importance of defining reusable blocks of code. I also explored the basics of functions in Python using the official documentation.

What I Learned:

Defining Functions: Learned how to define a function in Python using the def keyword, along with understanding indentation and scope.
Calling Functions: Practiced calling functions and executing the code inside them.
Code Reusability: Functions allow us to write once and call many times, improving code efficiency and organization.
Challenges:
Today’s concepts were straightforward, but I'm excited to dive deeper into more advanced function features such as arguments, return values, and function recursion.

Thoughts:
Functions are a key building block in Python, and I’m eager to use them in more complex scenarios like data processing and automation tasks. I also started working on a project in Karel the Robot, which will help solidify my understanding of functions in a fun, interactive environment.
